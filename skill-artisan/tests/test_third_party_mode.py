"""Regression test for audit.py's third-party source mode (issue #4).

Run: python3 -m unittest skill-artisan/tests/test_third_party_mode.py -v
(or `python3 -m unittest discover -s skill-artisan/tests` from anywhere)

Three checklist items (evals-present, security-scan-marker-current,
lifecycle-classified) verify artifacts only SkillArtisan's own pipeline
produces — its evals schema, its packaging tamper marker, its lifecycle
convention. Across all six audit-pilot corpora (1,418 skills) they FAILed
on effectively every skill not authored through the pipeline, regardless
of quality; RESULTS.md's conclusion was that this undercuts trust in the
real findings reported alongside them. The fix: a per-skill source
resolution (auto/first-party/third-party) that reports those three as a
new N/A status — informative detail, excluded from the pass-rate
denominator — when the skill is third-party. Detection is deliberately
"ANY pipeline artifact present -> first-party": requiring all artifacts
would let a fresh first-party draft silently reclassify as third-party
and skip the exact gate those checks exist to enforce; --source
first-party remains the explicit override for artifact-less drafts.
See benchmark/audit-pilot/RESULTS.md and issue #4.
