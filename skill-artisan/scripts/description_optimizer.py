"""Optimize a skill's frontmatter description for trigger accuracy.

Ported from skill-creator's scripts/run_eval.py + run_loop.py +
improve_description.py + generate_report.py (row 15), consolidated into one
CLI per the scripts/ discipline (row 34) rather than four cooperating files.
No loss of capability: same 60/40 train/validation split (shuffled once,
fixed across iterations), same 3x-runs-per-query trigger rate against a 0.5
threshold, same up-to-5-iteration loop, same selection-by-validation-score
(not last-iteration) logic, same live-refreshing HTML report.

Claude Code only — this script shells out to `claude -p`, which doesn't
exist on Claude.ai or Cowork. Skip description optimization entirely on
those surfaces (see creating-skills/references/surface-matrix.md); there is
no fallback path, since the CLI is the only way to run a query against the
model that's actually powering the current session.

Usage:
    python scripts/description_optimizer.py run \\
        --eval-set trigger_evals.json --skill-path ./my-skill \\
        --model <model-id-powering-this-session>

    python scripts/description_optimizer.py report results.json -o report.html

Skill content (for context on what the skill does):
<skill_content>
{skill_content}
</skill_content>

Based on the failures, write a new and improved description more likely to trigger correctly. Generalize from the failures to broader categories of user intent rather than producing an ever-expanding list of specific queries — that overfits, and the description gets injected into every query alongside every other skill's description, so it needs to stay compact.

Keep it under about 100-200 words; there is a hard 1024-character limit (over that gets truncated, so stay comfortably under it).

Tips that work well:
- Imperative voice: "Use this skill for..." rather than "this skill does..."
- Focus on the user's intent, not the skill's implementation details.
- Make it distinctive — it competes with other skills' descriptions for Claude's attention.
- If repeated attempts keep failing, change sentence structure, not just wording.

# fixed seed, and never rotates. Confirmed directly on a real corpus
# (bilibili-source, 9 should-trigger examples, default holdout=0.4): the
# 3 should-trigger queries that landed in validation failed identically
# across all 5 iterations, completely unmoved by materially different
# description rewrites, because the optimizer had zero visibility into them
# from iteration 1 onward. Below this many examples per class, a single
# query flipping swings the reported validation score by 20+ percentage
