"""Audit an existing skill (or a whole directory of them) against the Gap
Table's Synthesized Checklist, and recommend upgrade-vs-rebuild.

Row 31, 32; Stage 6. Reuses v1's Stage 1-4 infrastructure rather than
reimplementing it: `validate.py` for frontmatter/naming/path-references,
`security_scan.py` for gitleaks/pattern findings and the tamper marker,
`_common.find_skill_dirs` for bulk-mode discovery. This script does NOT run
the eval engine itself — regression benchmarking (item 4 below) needs the
Task tool to spawn subagents, which a standalone script can't do; that
orchestration is `SKILL.md`'s job (see "Auditing existing skills"), exactly
the same division of labor v1 already uses for the eval engine proper.

What this script CAN verify mechanically vs. what needs a human/LLM read:
most of the Synthesized Checklist's structural items (frontmatter validity,
security-scan cleanliness, evals presence, body-size limits, reference
depth) are checkable from the files alone. A handful of items are
judgment calls no pattern can substitute for — multi-model testing actually
having happened, whether a description's triggering logic is *good* and not
just present, whether the skill's boundary is genuinely one coherent unit of
work. Those are reported as MANUAL, not guessed at or silently skipped —
per the master spec's own instruction: "never a bare binary verdict."

Usage:
    python scripts/audit.py report <skill-path>
    python scripts/audit.py report <skill-path> --timelessness 8 --lifecycle capability-uplift
    python scripts/audit.py report <skill-path> --json
    python scripts/audit.py bulk <skills-dir>
    python scripts/audit.py bulk <skills-dir> --json
    python scripts/audit.py pr-plan <skill-path> --upstream-repo <owner/repo>

Exit codes: 0 report generated (regardless of pass/fail — this is a report,
not a gate, same convention as dedup_search.py), 2 path not found,
4 SKILL.md unreadable/unparseable.

# content structurally can't match an English regex; a short CJK description
# can carry as much semantic content as a much longer English one, so the
# character-count floor undercounts it. Rather than guess at per-script
# regex/thresholds with no linguistic verification (real risk of encoding a
# wrong pattern with false confidence — worse than an honest gap), a
# predominantly non-Latin-script description gets MANUAL instead of a
# confident FAIL/WARN the check structurally cannot evaluate. Threshold
# picked empirically against both corpora: skills whose description is
# actually written in English (even in a Korean/Chinese-authored repo) sit

# Issue #12: an author-provided skill-authoring template (fill-in-the-blank
# scaffolding, not real content) gets discovered and audited as an ordinary
# skill, then drawn a misleading rebuild/FAIL verdict — a category error,
# since the content isn't broken, it's meant to contain placeholders.
# Confirmed on 6 real instances across the audit pilot (Phases 13, 19x2, 20,
# 22, 24). A `find_skill_dirs`-level directory-name exclusion was checked and
# rejected: 102 real, already-audited skills across two corpora legitimately
# use `templates/skills/<name>/` as their real skill-storage convention, so
# blindly excluding it would silently drop real content — a real regression,
# not a hypothetical one (see benchmark/vendored/README.md's Phase 19 entry).
# This check instead looks at content, narrowly, in exactly the two places
# every confirmed instance actually signals template-ness:
#   1. `name:` containing literal template syntax ({{...}}, [TODO:...], and
#      similar bracket-wrapped placeholder markers) — real skill names are
#      kebab-case identifiers that essentially never contain braces/brackets,
#      so this has very little room for a false positive on genuine content.
#   2. `description:` matching one of a handful of specific, verbatim
#      self-declaring phrasings pulled directly from the six real instances
#      (not a broad "contains the word template" match, which would risk a
#      real skill *about* authoring templates or examples).
# A skill that trips neither signal is graded normally, exactly as before.

# A skill counts as first-party if ANY pipeline artifact is present: one
# artifact means it entered the pipeline, so hold it to the full checklist.
# Deliberately not "all artifacts present" — that would make the three checks
# unfalsifiable (a fresh first-party draft missing an artifact would silently
# reclassify as third-party and skip the gate it exists to enforce). Authors
# can always force the mode with --source.
