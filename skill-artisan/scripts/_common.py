    Architectural note (Phase 13 of the real-world audit pilot,
    `bobmatnyc/claude-mpm-skills`, 2026-08-20): through Phase 12, this
    function enumerated ten fixed glob patterns, each added incrementally as
    a new real-world packaging shape was found (a plugin's own `skills/`
    subdirectory, a nested mini-plugin one level deeper, a `plugins/` wrapper,
    platform sub-skills one or two levels beneath an already-discovered
    skill, a literal top-level `skills/` collection with two or three
    category levels, a `plugins/<product>/<version>/skills/<category>/<name>`
    shape — the full provenance for each lives in this project's git history
    and `benchmark/audit-pilot/RESULTS.md`, not repeated here). `bobmatnyc`
    broke that model outright: `universal/security/threat-modeling/SKILL.md`,
    `toolchains/php/frameworks/wordpress/wordpress-security-validation/SKILL.md`
    — plain category nesting at arbitrary depth, with no `skills/` marker
    directory anywhere to anchor a pattern against. No finite list of
    fixed-depth patterns can cover arbitrary depth; the fixed-pattern-list
    model had reached the shape of problem it can't solve. Replaced with a
    plain recursive walk (`rglob("SKILL.md")`), filtered by the same
    symlink-skip and intermediate-directory-exclusion logic already in place.
    **Verified safe before switching, not assumed**: run head-to-head against
    all nineteen corpora already vendored at the time (not sampled) —
    identical results everywhere except two, both confirmed improvements, not
    regressions: `bobmatnyc` itself (172 real skills recovered) and
    `aws-agent-toolkit-for-aws` (naturally recovers the single
    `agents-pay`-under-`packages`-under-`agents-pay` sub-package skill that
    Phase 9 had deliberately left undiscovered as "not worth a fifth
    single-purpose pattern" — the recursive walk needs no new pattern to
    reach it). Also faster in a direct timing comparison on the largest
    corpus (817 skills): ten overlapping glob passes versus one tree walk.

    Skips any match reached through a symlink, at any level — found via the
    audit pilot's Phase 6, alirezarezvani/claude-skills: some
    skills are packaged twice, once in a flat per-category `skills/`
    collection and again as a fully self-contained, individually-installable
    mini-plugin one level deeper. Checked exhaustively, not sampled, before
    adding this: 113 of 125 skills at this depth have *no* flat counterpart
    at all — genuinely unique content this discovery previously missed
    entirely, not redundant packaging of something already found; the same
    repo also symlink-mirrors every skill into four cross-tool directories
    (`.codex/`, `.gemini/`, `.hermes/`, `.vibe/`) for compatibility with
    other agent products, and `Path.glob()`/`rglob()` follow symlinks for
    ordinary path components — unfiltered, that inflated discovery from 785
    real skills to 1,140+, the same skill re-counted once per mirror.

    Excludes any match whose path (between the search root and the skill's
    own directory, exclusive of that directory's own name) passes through a
    directory named `assets`, `tests`, `fixtures`, or `example`. Each entry
    is backed by a confirmed real instance, not a guess: `assets`
    (`alirezarezvani-claude-skills`' `skill-tester/assets/sample-skill/`,
    Phase 8), `tests`/`fixtures`
    (`tripleyak-skillforge`'s `scripts/tests/fixtures/sample-skill/`, Phase 8;
    corroborated by `dotnet/skills`' `eng/skill-validator/tests/fixtures/`,
    Phase 12), `example` (`flutter/agent-plugins`'
    `tool/dart_skills_lint/example/skills/{valid,invalid}/`, Phase 12 — two
    deliberate linter test fixtures, both explicitly self-described as
    fixtures in their own body text and both carrying
    `metadata: {internal: true}`). Checked against every corpus already
    vendored each time a name was added: zero legitimate discoveries lost.

    Shared by dedup_search.py (searching for prior art) and audit.py's bulk
    mode (auditing a whole skills directory) — one implementation per the
    scripts/ discipline in references/script-design.md, not two copies that
    drift apart. Does not deduplicate by *content* — the same real-world
    check found 12 of 125 nested-layer skills (Phase 6) are byte-identical
    repackagings of a flat-layer sibling; a caller that cares about auditing
    each unique skill exactly once (like aggregate_findings.py) needs to
    dedup on top of this function's output, since deciding "these two paths
    are the same skill" is a judgment about content, not about directory
    structure, which is deliberately outside this function's job.
