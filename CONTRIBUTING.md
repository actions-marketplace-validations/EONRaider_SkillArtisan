# Contributing to SkillArtisan

Notes for anyone developing SkillArtisan itself, not just installing it — the repo's own layout, the plugin's internal architecture, and how to exercise the eval engine's subagents without a real install.

## Repo layout

```

```

`skill-artisan-master-spec.md` stays at the root because it documents the *build process* itself, not the plugin — there's no equivalent inside `skill-artisan/`. `CHANGELOG.md` exists only inside `skill-artisan/` — one canonical copy, not duplicated at root, since its content is versioned narrative that would drift. `README.md` exists at *both* levels, but this is not the drift-risk duplication described above: the root `README.md` is the repo's front door (why the project exists, install instructions, the GitHub Action, licensing/credits) aimed at someone deciding whether to use SkillArtisan at all, while `skill-artisan/README.md` is the live plugin doc aimed at someone who already installed it — it explicitly defers back to the root README for anything not specific to the installed plugin, rather than repeating it. `LICENSE` is duplicated at root *and* inside `skill-artisan/` on purpose — static boilerplate text with no drift risk, and GitHub's own tooling (license detection, GitHub Marketplace's publish-eligibility check) reads the repo-root copy specifically, while the `skill-artisan/` copy is what actually ships with the installed plugin.

## Plugin architecture

SkillArtisan ships as a plugin, not a single skill, because its infrastructure genuinely needs more than one file. `action.yml` at the repo root makes the audit installable as a GitHub Action in third-party repos too — see the root README's "GitHub Action" section.

```
skill-artisan/
├── .claude-plugin/plugin.json
├── creating-skills/          # the main skill — entry point, decision gate
│   ├── SKILL.md
│   └── references/
├── agents/                   # eval subagents (grader, comparator, analyzer)
├── eval-viewer/               # HTML review UI for benchmark results
├── assets/
├── scripts/                  # validation, security scanning, dedup search, eval loop, audit
├── benchmark/                 # regression/QA harness + corpus for testing creating-skills
│                              #   itself — development tooling, not part of the installed skill
├── LICENSE
├── CHANGELOG.md
├── .skillignore
└── README.md
```

Full rationale in the project's [master specification](skill-artisan-master-spec.md).

## Testing subagents locally

The eval engine's `grader`/`comparator`/`analyzer` subagents (`agents/*.md`) are only invocable via `Task(subagent_type: ...)` once the plugin is genuinely installed — installing it locally mid-session does not make them available in that same session, since Claude Code's subagent-type registry is fixed at session start. A repo-context session (this repo open directly, not installed) should follow each agent's documented process by hand instead — see `skill-artisan/creating-skills/SKILL.md`'s "Testing and evaluating" section.
